## Welcome to SpaceStory!

## About the game

In SpaceStory you are controlling the weapons of three spacecrafts as they venture in 32+1 missions.
In every mission you have to destroy all 75 asteroids the asteroid field contains.
If you are playing with a keyboard you can use the buttons a,s,d to control the blaster shots.
However, in order for the buttons to work, keyboard language should be English and CapsLock should be off
(this means, no capitalized letters).
If you are playing with a touchscreen, you can tap the image of the spacecraft whose blaster you
want to use, in order for it to shoot, or you can tap the column that the spacecraft is in. Double tap zoom
is disabled when you are on the game screen for a better user experience.
Once all asteroids of a column are destroyed, the spacecraft of said column will no longer shoot.
If you are playing in landscape mode and you fail your mission, the "abort mission" message
might appear behind the spacecrafts. This is to simply remind you how much better it is to play in portrait
mode. If you switch to portrait mode, you should be easily able to click the "abort" button. If you are still not
able to do so, just go to the previous page.

## Offline use

The app has been programmed as a Progressive Web App (PWA). This means that you can install it
and use it offline, if your device supports it. If you are using Chrome on Android, you can press
the three dots on the top right corner ot the window, click install app, and wait two to three minutes.
After this the app will be on your homescreen. When using the offline mode, every time you enter a window
(level or other screen) you hadn't entered before in offline mode, you need to be connected to the Internet,
so that the contents can be cached. The whole webpage does not exceed 13MB, so the app should have at most 13MB size.
