                        In SpaceStory you are controlling the weapons of three spacecrafts, as they venture in 32
                        missions.
                        <br>
                        In every mission you have to destroy all 75 asteroids the asteroid field contains.
                        <br>
                        If you are playing with a keyboard you can use the buttons a,s,d to control the blaster shots.
                        However,
                        in order for the buttons to work, keyboard language should be English and CapsLock should be off
                        (this means,
                        no capitalized letters).
                        <br>
                        If you are playing with a touchscreen, you can tap the image of the spacecraft whose blaster you
                        want to use,
                        in order for it to shoot, or you can tap the column that the spacecraft is in. Double tap zoom
                        is disabled
                        when you are on the game screen for a better user experience.
                        <br>
                        Once all asteroids of a column are destroyed, the spacecraft of said column will no longer
                        shoot.
                        <br>
                        If you are playing in landscape mode and you fail your mission, the "abort mission" message
                        might appear
                        behind the spacecrafts. This is to simply remind you how much better it is to play in portrait
                        mode. If you switch
                        to portrait mode, you should be easily able to click the "abort" button. If you are still not
                        able to do so, just go
                        to the previous page.

                        Sun Tzu was a Chinese general, military strategist, writer, and philosopher who lived in the
                        Eastern Zhou period of ancient China.
                        Sun Tzu is traditionally credited as the author of The Art of War, an influential work of
                        military stratefy that has affected both
                        Western and East Asian philosophy and military thinking. His works focus much more on
                        alternatives to battle, such as stratagem, delay,
                        the use of spies and alternative to war itself, the making and keeping of alliances, the uses of

                        Socrates was a Greek philospher from Athens who is credited as one of the founders of Western

                        Julius Caesar (100BC-44BC)
                        <br>
                        Gaius Julius Caesar was a Roman general and statesman who played a critical role in the events
                        that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire.
                        In 60 BC, Caesar, Crassus and Pompey formed the First Triumvirate, a political alliance that
                        dominated Roman politics for several years. Their attempts to amass power as Populares
                        were opposed by the Optimates within the Roman Senate, among them Cato the Younger with the
                        frequent support of Cicero. Caesar rose to become one of the most powerful
                        politicians in the Roman Republic through a string of military victories in the Gallic Wars,
                        completed by 51BC, which greatly extended Roman territory. During this time he both
                        invaded Britain and built a bridge across the Rhine river. These achievements and the support of
                        his veteran army threatened to eclipse the standing of Pompey, who had himself
                        realigned with the Senate after the death of Crassus in 53BC. With the Gallic Wars concluded,
                        the Senate ordered Caesar to step down from his military command and return to Rome.
                        Leaving his command in Gaul would mean losing his immunity to criminal prosecution by his
                        enemies; knowing this, Caesar openly defied the Senate's authority by crossing the Rubicon
                        and marching towards Rome at the head of an army. This began Caesar's civil war, which he won,
                        leaving him in a position of near unchallenged power and influence.

                        Wiliam I, usually known as William the Conqueror, was the first Norman monarch of England,

                        of Rollo and was Duke of Normandy from 1035 onward. By 1060, following a long struggle to
                        establish his throne, his hold on Normandy was secure. In 1066,
                        William invaded England, leading an army of Normans to victory over the Anglo-Saxon forces of
                        Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings,
                        and suppressed subsequent English revolts in what has become known as the Norman Conquest. The

                        Genghis Khan, was the founder and first Great Khan (Emperor) of the Mongol Empire, which became
                        the largest contiguous empire in history after his death. He came to power by uniting many of
                        the nomadic tribes of Northeast Asia. After founding the Empire and being proclaimed Genghis
                        Khan he launched the Mongol invasions that conquered most of Eurasia, reaching as far west as
                        Poland in Europe and the Levant in the Middle East. Campaigns initiated in his lifetime include
                        those against the Qara Khitai, Khwarezmia, and the Western Xia and Jin dynasties, and raids into
                        Medieval Georgia, the Kievan Rus', and Volga Bulgaria. These campaigns were often accompanied by

                        Xia-controlled lands. Because of this brutality, which left millions dead, he is considered by
                        many to have been a brutal ruler. By the end of his life, the Mongol Empire occupied a
                        substantial portion of Central Asia and China. Due to his exceptional military successes,
                        Genghis Khan is often considered to be one of the greatest conquerors of all time.

                        Napoleon I, he was Emperor of the French from 1804 until 1814, and again in 1815. Napoleon
                        dominated European and global affairs for more than a decade while leading France against a
                        series of coalitions in the Napoleonic Wars. He won most of these wars and the vast majority of
                        his battles, building a large empire that ruled over continental Europe before its final
                        collapse in 1815. One of the greatest commanders in history, his wars and campaigns are studied
                        at military schools worldwide. He remains one of the most celebrated and controversial political
                        figures in human history.
